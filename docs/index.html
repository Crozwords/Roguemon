            <h1>What is RogueMon?</h1>
            <ul class="features">
                <p>RogueMON combines elements of Roguelikes, Ironmon Game Modes, and Randomized Challenges.</p>
                <p>The goal is to win by locking every pokemon type and finishing a run without fainting. on your journey, you'll receive prizes to help you on your way. Curses will hinder your path. All resources to get set up available in the discord listed above.</p>
                
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="roguelikes">
            <h1>ROGUELIKES</h1>
            <p>Often have difficult choices and a “linear” element.</p>
            <p>The goal is to go straight through the game and as you do, you get offered random sets of items for achieving milestones.</p>
            <p>There are randomly 'cursed' sections of the game which offer fun and interesting challenges to overcome.</p>
            <p>There are ‘buy’ phases and ‘cleansing’ phases (described in rules) where you can exchange current items to upgrade them and/or win items to use on your quest for victory.</p>
            <p>There will also be ‘ascensions’ or difficulty levels to progress through.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="ironmon">
            <h1>IRONMON</h1>
            <p>Roguelikes and Ironmon both have a “permadeath” feature.</p>
            <p>The goal of the challenge is to complete the entirety of the game without your lead pokemon fainting by only fighting trainers. All stats, abilities, items, moves (learnable via level and TMs) are randomized.</p>
            <p>Unlike Ironmon, evolutions in RogueMON will SHARE BST distribution AND ability. Any additional BST from the evolution will be randomly distributed ON TOP of the previous mons.</p>
            <p>Example: Charmander evolves into Combusken. The SPD gets a slight buff from the additional base stats where the DEF got nothing. Both have Mold Breaker.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="evolutions">
        <h1>EVOLUTIONS</h1>
            <p>All pokemon available in the game will be able to evolve at least once. Evolutions are randomized, but with some logic:</p>
            <p>The evolution will share a type with the previous form, and will be of approximately similar BST to what it is “supposed” to become (usually within +/-10%).</p>
            <p>No cancelling evolutions. Everstones are allowed if desired, if acquired by a prize. Roguestone use is a choice.</p>
            <p>Base stats and ability upon evolving are carried over to the new pokemon, with the additional base stats randomly going on top.</p>
            <p>In FRLG Natdex, all pokemon with a BST less than or equal to 450 that normally would not evolve are given a new evolution, in order to ensure that you can end up with something reasonably strong. This evolution will occur at the level of the BST of the evolution target divided by 10. Note, this will not be known until it is hit!</p>
            <p>Example: If Wobbuffet (405 BST) were to evolve into Delphox (534 BST), this evolution would occur at level 53.</p>

        <section>
            <h1>Difficulty equivalence?</h1>
            <p>Ascension 1 is closer to "Ultimate IronMon".</p>
            <p>Ascension 2, and Kaizo IronMon are similar difficulty, but you're also likely to win in less 'attempts'. </p>
            <p>Ascension 3 hasn't had much testing, and is still in development, with that said it will likely fall between Kaizo IronMon and Super Kaizo IronMon.</p>

            <h1>General Questions</h1>
            <p>Q : In A1 when can you equip the lucky egg?</p>
            <p>A : You can equip it as soon as you get it, but after you beat Brock it's gotta go.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q : I'm struggling with getting RogueMon running</p>
            <p>A : The discord is currently the best place to get any help, it has many resources and you are free to ask questions</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q : Where is the Move Re-learner?</p>
            <P>A : It's in Celadon City, in the house next to the Pokemon Center. This can not be pre-scouted</P>
            <br>
            <p>Q : What does evolution "BST/10" mean?</p>
            <p>A : The bst of whatever you evo into /10. So if you are a Minior that evos into a galarian articuno(580bst). Your Minior will evo at level 58 for 580/10.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q : How do I move to Ascension 2 attempts?</p>
            <p>A : Make new profiles with the AS2 rnqs files, then in the tracker go to the RogueMon extension go into options and tick 5 Curses</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q : How do I start new games directly in the lab?</p>
            <p>A : Go to the lab or where you want to save, save using the in-game menus, then flush the SaveRAM (Bizhawk > File > SaveRAM > Flush).</p>

                    <p>Wild Pokemon have a 50% increase to their level in all ascensions.</p>
                    
                    <p>Once you fight a non-rival trainer, you are LOCKED with your current pokemon for the attempt.</p>
                    
                    <p>You may catch 5 pokemon, and then choose ONE to attempt the challenge, including the same pokemon 5 times if you choose.</p>
                    
                    <p>Once you select the ONE pokemon you are going to run, you may keep the item it’s holding if it has one, treating it as though you picked it up from the ground.</p>
                    
                    <p>You may heal freely while you are catching your 5 pokemon. However, if your lead pokemon faints your run ends.</p>
                    
                    <p>You may swap your lead pokemon at any time during this phase. You may use moves on wild pokemon, but you can’t intentionally faint them. If you do happen to defeat a wild, you cannot run the pokemon that gained experience.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you are trapped and cannot escape, you can catch the pokemon that trapped you, but it counts as one of your 5 catches.If you are trapped before obtaining balls, you may KO the pokemon in good faith and continue.</p>
                    
                    <p>After locking your pokemon to run, you can catch and release any wild pokemon you wish later on in the run.</p>
                    
                    <p>All pokemon that evolve with any stone/item now take a "Roguestone" to evolve. Roguestones you find randomly can be kept and used at any time after gym 1.</p>
                    
                    <p>Shiny Rule - If you are scouting your mon to run, and find a shiny, you must attempt to run it or face the wrath of Croz.</p>

The consumable can never go back into the bag once equipped but can be used if unequipped.</p>
                    
                    <p>Leppa Berries and status berries (e.g. Lum, Chesto) can be kept and treated as a regular PP/status heal.</p>
                    
                    <p>You may choose to equip status/pp berries; if you do, then they are treated like normal consumables.</p>
                    
                    <p>If the consumable replaces another consumable, the one being unequipped must be trashed/used.</p>
                    
                    <p>If the consumable is replacing a won held item, the held item goes into the bag and can be re-equipped.</p>
                    
                    <p>Held berries do not count against your HP/status bag limit, but berries in your bag do.</p>

                    <h1>OTHER ITEMS</h1>
                    <p>Between Gyms, Items you pick up can be KEPT, temporarily – but they can’t be used yet. It’s possible you can Win/Choose to keep them via a Prize. If you don’t Win/Choose them from a prize, they will get trashed in the next Cleansing Phase.</p>

                    <p>Think of your bag as a temporary holding space for some possible items you can win when you get a prize.</p>

                    <p>Exception - Pre-Gym 1 held item. Until you have cleared the first gym, you may use any non banned held items OR any found battle items you pick up, with no restrictions. These items must all be trashed during the cleansing phase after completing Gym 1.</p>

                    <p>Revive note: Revives are treated as being in the other items category. You may only use one if you unlock from a prize roll. If you obtain a legal Revive, this is how to use it upon fainting: send your HM friend in, use the revive, then use moves with the HM friend until it faints. As such, your HM friend should always be with you if you have one. If a trainer swaps your HM friend in, you may attack with moves until it faints, but this will forfeit your ability to use a revive until you can use a Pokemon Center. You are limited to ONE HM friend, and owning ONE revive item per run.</p>
